Research Gate is a social networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers, ask and answer questions, and find collaborators.

people who wish to become site members need to have an email address at a recognized institution or to be manually confirmed as a published researcher in order to sign up for an account.

Members of the site each have a user profile and can upload research output including papers, data, chapters, negative results, patents, research proposals, methods, presentations, and software source code.
